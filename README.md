Jarvis – AI Voice Assistant (Beta)

Jarvis (a.k.a. Jarviz) is a smart, voice-controlled AI assistant with a graphical interface. It helps you interact using natural voice commands and provides a clean, modern UI — including dark mode, voice waveform graphics, and integration with simple automation tasks like launching apps (in local mode).

⚠️ Note: This is an early prototype (Beta version). There are multiple known bugs and features under development. Community feedback and contributions are welcome!

Click the 🎙️ mic and say "Jarvis"

Speak commands like:

“What’s the time?”

“Open YouTube”

“Search for Python tutorials”

“Open VS Code” (Only on local setup)

Jarvis will respond with voice + text in the GUI

Known Issues & Limitations
❗ Sometimes fails to recognize or execute voice commands

❗ Not all browsers support the full voice API (Chrome preferred)

❗ Desktop automation (like launching VS Code) only works in local Python mode

❗ Wake-word detection is unreliable in some environments

🧪 Backend integration and command error handling are incomplete

This is a work-in-progress project, so expect minor to moderate bugs.
